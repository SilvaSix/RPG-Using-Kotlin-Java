# First Turned Based RPG
Exploring the fundamentals of Java and kotlin programming.
Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation

Examples for the fundamentals being used:

Abstraction:  When this program runs you only see whats needed.

Encapsulation: We need to use getters and setters.

Inheritance: We have parent(super) and child(sub) classes used.  

Polymorphism: Child classes inherit parent methods and have thier own.


Currently based on turn based.
Possible I will switch it to real time in the future.
Much to come.
